CamelCase Time Complexity:
The time complexity of CamelCase is O(n) because there is a single loop iterating through string S of length n.

CamelCase Space Complexity:
The space complexity of CamelCase is also O(n) where n is the length of string S because it is the only major variable being used in the code.  The integer variables are not prominent enough to change the space complexity.
