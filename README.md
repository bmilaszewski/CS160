Time Complexity

The time complexity for MiniMaxSum is O(n). This is because the function iterates once through an array from i = 0, to i = n-1. It iterates in a linear manner so therefore the complexity is O(n).

The time complexity for HackerRankInAString in O(n*m) where n is the length of the string being inputted and m is the length of the string that is trying to be found.  This is because it iterates linearly (O(n)) similar to the previous function, but it has to do it m number of times.
